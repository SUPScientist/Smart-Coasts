# Lecture 2
Our goal today is to become more familiar with git and GitHub. We already started using it last week (these lecture notes are stored on GitHub) but we did so without talking about what it is and why we use it. 

Since the professionals at GitHub are better at describing it than I am, let's start with their curated resources. Complete the [Introduction to GitHub course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).
