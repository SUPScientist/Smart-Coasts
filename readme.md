# Smart Coasts, OCN 479
Welcome to Smart Coasts. This GitHub repository provides a supplement to the OCN 479 Canvas page and in-class activities. In particular, this repo will be used to provide code examples and getting started tips.
## Project Ideas
In Fall 2022, we will attempt to build a low-cost bio-optical water quality sensor package for citizen/community science applications. Additional sensors and networks may be designed as well, according to student interest, time, and resources. Here are some relevant links:
- Chlorophyll fluorometer, based on design described in *In situ Measurements of Phytoplankton Fluorescence Using Low Cost Electronics* by Leeuw et al. (2013). https://doi.org/10.3390/s130607872.
- Optical backscattering/turbidimetry, based on a design described in *OpenOBS: Open-source, low-cost optical backscatter sensors for water quality and sediment-transport research* by Eidam et al. (2022). https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10469. 
- Additionally, we may try to build low-cost water level sensors, if there is student interest and a novel deployment and/or sensor development idea. See https://github.com/SUPScientist/Seaport_Tide-SLR to get started.
- Low-cost multiparameter water quality instrument with datalogging, following *Testing the Waters: A Demonstration of a Novel Water Quality Mapping System for Citizen Science Groups* by Compas and Wade (2018).
